# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This GitHub repository contains Python notebooks for four machine learning tasks:

## Task 1: Movie Genre Classification
The objective of this task is to create a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. Techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings are utilized along with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.

## Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
This task involves building a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset containing information about credit card transactions. Various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests, are experimented with to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

## Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction
The aim of this task is to develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. Historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics, is used. Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting are employed to predict churn.

## Task 4: Spam SMS Detection
This task involves building an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings are combined with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages.
