# NeuroNexus Innovation Projects

Welcome to the Machine Learning and Python Programming Projects Repository! This collection of Python notebooks brings together a diverse range of projects aimed at machine-learning enthusiasts and Python programmers. Whether you're diving into the realms of predictive modelling, artificial intelligence, or honing your Python programming skills, this repository has something for you.

## Machine Learning

Explore the world of machine learning with tasks such as Movie Genre Classification, Credit Card Fraud Detection, Customer Churn Prediction, and Spam SMS Detection. Each project offers hands-on experience with popular techniques and algorithms, accompanied by clear implementations in Python notebooks.

1. **Movie Genre Classification:** Predict movie genres using TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM.

2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection:** Detect fraudulent transactions with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.

3. **Customer Churn Prediction:** Predict customer churn with Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting.

4. **Spam SMS Detection:** Identify spam using TF-IDF or word embeddings with Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM.

## Artificial Intelligence

Delve into artificial intelligence with projects like building a Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses, creating an Image-Captioning AI, developing a Recommendation System, and implementing Face Detection and Recognition. These projects cover the intersection of natural language processing, computer vision, and recommendation systems.

1. **Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses:** Build a simple chatbot using if-else statements or pattern matching.

2. **Image Captioning:** Combine computer vision and NLP for image captioning with pre-trained models like VGG or ResNet.

3. **Recommendation System:** Create a simple recommendation system using collaborative or content-based filtering.

4. **Face Detection and Recognition:** Develop an AI application using pre-trained models for face detection and recognition.

## Python Programming

Sharpen your Python programming skills with practical projects including a To-Do List application, a basic Calculator, a Password Generator, a Rock-Paper-Scissors Game, and a Contact Book. Each project is designed to enhance your understanding of Python fundamentals while delivering functional applications.

1. **To-Do List:** Create a To-Do List application allowing users to manage tasks efficiently through a command-line or GUI-based Python application.

2. **Calculator:** Design a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations, prompting users to input numbers and an operation choice.

3. **Password Generator:** Generate strong and random passwords with a password generator application allowing users to specify length and complexity.

4. **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game:** Create a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game with user input, computer selection, game logic, and optional score tracking.

5. **Contact Book:** Develop a contact book application to store, add, view, search, update, and delete contacts.
