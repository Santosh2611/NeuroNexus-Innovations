# Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence Projects

This GitHub repository hosts a collection of Python notebooks showcasing diverse machine learning and artificial intelligence projects. Each project provides practical implementations using popular techniques and algorithms.

## Machine Learning

1. **Movie Genre Classification:** Predict movie genres using TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM.

2. **Credit Card Fraud Detection:** Detect fraudulent transactions with Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.

3. **Customer Churn Prediction:** Predict customer churn with Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting.

4. **Spam SMS Detection:** Identify spam using TF-IDF or word embeddings with Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM.

## Artificial Intelligence

1. **Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses:** Build a simple chatbot using if-else statements or pattern matching.

2. **Image Captioning:** Combine computer vision and NLP for image captioning with pre-trained models like VGG or ResNet.

3. **Recommendation System:** Create a simple recommendation system using collaborative or content-based filtering.

4. **Face Detection and Recognition:** Develop an AI application using pre-trained models for face detection and recognition.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
